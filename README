*****************Disk on RAM************************************************

This is a block driver which creates 512 KB of RAM as block driver and reads and writes to it from the terminal.
The 512 bytes of RAM allocated is partitioned into 3 primary and 3 logical partitions.

Steps to make the driver
$make
$sudo insmod ./dor.ko

To check the partitions 
$ls -l /dev/DiskonRAM*

TO write into a partition ( eg. DiskonRAM1)
$cat > /dev/DiskonRAM1

To read from the partition
$xxd /dev/DiskonRAM1

To format a partition into various file systems
if vfat then
$mkfs.vfat /dev/DiskonRAM2   
if ext3 then
$mkfs.ext3 /dev/DiskonRAM2

You can also use other commands for the same

You can now mount the partition using /mnt , write data in it and then umount it using umount.

To remove the kernel module
$sudo rmmod dor

This will remove the partitions and the data in the partitions as well.
